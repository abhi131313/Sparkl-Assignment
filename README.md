Project Title: Sparkl Edventure Assignment Solution

Overview : 
This project is an interactive learning platform that leverages engaging animations and dynamic UI elements to create an immersive learning experience. The platform is built using React and showcases a series of components that respond to user interactions such as clicks and scrolling to enhance the visual appeal and usability.

Features : 

Animated Interactions: Smooth animations guide user interactions, making the UI more engaging and intuitive.

Scroll-Based Animations: Words in paragraphs dynamically transition from dull to bright as the user scrolls down, and revert when scrolling up, offering a visually engaging reading experience.

Responsive Layout: The platform is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across all devices.


Click-Based Animations: Elements like teacher and student images reposition and resize based on user clicks, enhancing the interactivity of the platform.

Components :
1. FirstPage Component
Purpose: Lays out the initial view of the platform with specific section placements and animations.
Features: Precise alignment, image scaling without distortion, and responsive design to match the expected UI.

2. SecondPage Component
Purpose: Provides a paragraph text animation effect where words brighten as the user scrolls down and dim when scrolling up.
Features: Ensures the paragraph starts from the first word and responds accurately to scroll actions, providing a smooth transition effect.

3. ThirdPage Component
Purpose: Handles dynamic click-based animations for teacher and student images, enhancing the interactive learning experience.
Features:
First Click: Displays a large teacher image and smaller student images at the bottom with a fade-in effect.
Second Click: Moves the teacher image to the top-right, resizes and repositions student images, and displays a different learning Image in the center.
